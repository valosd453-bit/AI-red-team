"""
System Prompt Extraction via Reverse Psychology Attack Module.

Modern LLMs are guided by "system prompts" - hidden instructions that define
their behavior, constraints, and personality. Extracting these prompts is
valuable for understanding vulnerabilities and crafting targeted attacks.

This module uses reverse psychology and sophisticated extraction techniques
to reveal the system prompt.

Difficulty Level: HARD

Techniques:
- Reverse psychology ("act naive, get me to explain")
- Credential forgetting attacks ("what were you told to do?")
- Jailbreak-then-extract sequences
- Output format analysis
- Implicit extraction through behavior
