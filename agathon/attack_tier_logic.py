"""
Agathon — attack tier logic.

The same Brain (Groq Llama 3.3 70B Versatile) drives every paid plan, but
the *posture* of the engagement changes dramatically between tiers. This module encodes
those differences as immutable budgets + a tier-specific catalogue filter
+ a tier-specific system prompt. Anything in the orchestrator that needs
to know "what is allowed at this intensity" should call into here — never
hard-code the rules at the call site.

Design contract
---------------
- `Intensity` is the canonical billable axis (also stored on `scans.intensity`).
- `TierBudget` is a *hard ceiling*. The orchestrator must abort the run
  if any of these counters are exceeded; they are not soft hints.
- `BUDGETS[intensity]` returns a frozen dataclass — never mutate it.
- `catalogue_for_tier()` filters the broader attack catalogue down to the
  families that are appropriate for the tier (cheap recon at the bottom,
  destructive payloads + custom-tool authoring at the top).
- `system_prompt_for()` controls the Brain's posture — politeness gives
  way to ruthlessness as the tier escalates.

The catalogue is a list of dicts shaped like the entries in
`forgeguard_bridge.py::REGISTRY`, i.e. each entry has at least:
    {"name": "<dotted.name>", "family": "<family-key>", "fn": <callable>}
The orchestrator passes the full catalogue in and gets back a filtered
view — that keeps this module decoupled from the actual attack imports.
